The method in Java or Methods of Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific tasks and return the result to the caller. A Java method can perform some specific tasks without returning anything. Java Methods allows us to reuse the code without retyping the code.

It is a set of codes that perform a particular task.
Syntax of Method:
<access_modifier> <return_type> <method_name>( list_of_parameters)

Advantage of Method:

Code Reusability
Code Optimization
